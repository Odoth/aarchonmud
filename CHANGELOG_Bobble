- did the numbers, Shan-ya was too powerful. Reduced chance to activate based on health.
- merged/fixed acid_blast, was way overpowered.
- made conviction TARGET_OFFENSIVE and removed healing. Uses standard damage formula now.
- reduced power of Astark's rejuvenation. Now heals standard amount (*2/3 for group) and dispels maledictions at half level.
- fixed type conflict in do_mpcall
- firstaid now based on standard healing formula
