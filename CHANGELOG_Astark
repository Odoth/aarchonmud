6/1/2012 Astark
- EXP gains for hero level increased by 25%. Stops the huge fall-off in EXP gains after you hit level 90. Old rate would require players to kill roughly 35 mobs with 50,000 hp each, in order to gain 1 level (97 to 98). Change in fight.c

- Continual light will now get rid of dark flag on objects
- Giant strength now cancels weaken
- Wandering sages will now do a full lore of all items, even those with random or hidden stats
- Weapons made with hand of siva do less damage than other weapons of the same level, however 2H weapons have been improved so that they actually do more damage than 1H weapons. It should still be less than other 2H weapons of the same level
- Count command has been replaced with a snippet I found online. It writes to a maxwho.txt file and actually keeps better track of players that are online

- You can no longer void if you're being attacked by a pkiller

11/14/2012 Astark
- Exploration code added. Had to tweak a few things to get it to work. In merc.h I uncommented out one of the aliases and changed its name so that it wouldn't mess anything else up.
- Iron hide skill added for fighter types. Adds a permanent AC bonus that scales with level and is shown in affects. 
- Charmed mobs can no longer equip weapons
- Immortals don't see the 'you're drowning' message when under water

- Added achievements to show worth, which is included in do_score
- Many spells will no longer consume mana when they're unsuccessfully cast. Weather spells when used indoors, enchant armor when used on a weapon, etc.
- Iron maiden no longer will be triggered by NPCs. For example, if you have an army of zombies and you're fighting a mob, the mob will not take iron maiden damage when hitting an NPC
- Paralysis Poison created for thieves. This is like envenom (targets a weapon and then does damage over time when an opponent becomes afflicted)
- Envenom fixed to actually work. Can't remember what I changed.

- Malediction durations reduced.. no more 100 tick curse afflictions.

11/25/2012 Astark

12/21/2012 Astark
