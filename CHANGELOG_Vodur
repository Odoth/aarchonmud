- Contents of containers put in storage boxes are logged.
- Revamped box saving slightly so that instead of tracking it "storage_box" pointer attached to the player memfile, just keep a separate list of storage_box mfs. When player is saved, their boxes (if any) are saved and put on the list, when char is being written to file, their box (if found on list) is written then both mfs are removed from list and freed.
- Added 'printlist' command for lvl 110 which tracks status of mf lists (player_save_list, box_mf_list, player_quit_list).
- Check for storage box in char_from_room put inside if(!IS_NPC) bracket to avoid crashes in case a mob sneaks in somehow.
- container full message when using put all.


12/21/2012 Astark
- Added remorts 6 and 7. Also matched chambers on our port to main port although I'm not certain speed chambers are assigned to the right clone of each remort, but this shouldn't matter unless someone is in remort when the change is made
